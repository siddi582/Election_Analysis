Deliverable 3: Analysis of the Election Audit
1) Overview of Election Audit:
Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis:
The purpose of this project is to find out which county is the largest based off of votes. In module 3 we learned how to read csv files in python and begin to run the data with our coding skills. The data file has 4 columns, we had to search through the one that had all of the candidates and figure out how many votes each candidate recieved. Once we figure out the total votes and percentage of the total that they had we wrote the results to a text file with a winner. In the module 3 challenge we are doing something similar.This time we will search through the counties column to figure out the total votes and percentage of each county to find which county is the largest.

Calculate the total number of votes cast.
Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
Calculatae the total number of votes each candidate received.
Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.
After giving you an overview of the election audit tasks, we wants to go over the steps required in detail. Showing you a technique commonly used by programmers to write steps of their code, which is called pseudocode. Pseudocode will make the audit easier to present to nontechnical colleagues and stakeholders.

In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run:

Total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
Total number of votes each candidate received
Percentage of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
2) Election-Audit Results:
Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
Total Votes Cast in this congressional election was 369,711
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
County Votes:

Jefferson county has 10.5% total percentage with a total votes of 38,855
Denver county has the 82.8% total percentage with a total votes of 306,055
Arapahoe county has 6.7% total percentage with a total votes of 24,801
Which county had the largest number of votes?
County with Largest Number of Votes:

Denver county has the largest number total of 306,055
In addition, Denver county has the total votes percentage of 82.8%

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
Candidate Percentage of Votes:

Charles Casper Stockham candidate has 23.0% total percentage with a total votes of 85,213
Diana DeGette candidate has the 73.8 total percentage with a total votes of 272,892
Raymon Anthony Doane candidate has 3.1% total percentage with a total votes of 11,606
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
Election Results:

Diana DeGette won the election, with a total votes of 272,892
In addition, Diana DeGette has the total percentage votes of 73.8%
Diana DeGette is the Winner!
