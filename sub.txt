cd changes directory

cd ~ changes to home directory

cd .. moves up one directory

ls lists files in folder

pwd shows current directory

mkdir <FOLDERNAME> creates new directory

touch <FILENAME> creates a file

explorer . opens a specific file (Windows only)

Open Terminal or Git Bash and do the following, using only the command line:

Navigate to your desktop or directory: cd Desktop

Create a new directory named test: mkdir test

NOTE
When naming your directories and files, we recommend using underscores in place of spaces. So, for example, instead of naming a directory terminal prework, name it terminal_prework.

Create a new text file named sample: touch sample.txt

Navigate into the test directory: cd test

Check the contents of the directory (it should be empty): ls

Navigate back to your desktop: cd ..

Move the sample.txt file into the test directory: mv sample.txt test

Make sure the previous action was successful. Use cd test, press Enter, and then use ls.

Time for some independent learning! Using Google, find a way to rename the sample.txt file to example.txt.

What if I want to practice these commands? Then you are exactly the kind of student we are looking for: hungry for knowledge and eager to get your hands dirty!

This video (Links to an external site.) reviews the following steps.

Open Terminal or Git Bash and do the following, using only the command line:

Navigate to your desktop or directory: cd Desktop

Create a new directory named test: mkdir test

NOTE
When naming your directories and files, we recommend using underscores in place of spaces. So, for example, instead of naming a directory terminal prework, name it terminal_prework.

Create a new text file named sample: touch sample.txt

Navigate into the test directory: cd test

Check the contents of the directory (it should be empty): ls

Navigate back to your desktop: cd ..

Move the sample.txt file into the test directory: mv sample.txt test

Make sure the previous action was successful. Use cd test, press Enter, and then use ls.

This example renames example.txt to file.txt:

$ mv example.txt file.txt
Because they both use the same command, you can combine rename with a move. For instance, when moving example.txt to Documents, you could also rename it:

$ mv example.txt ~/Documents/file.txt
